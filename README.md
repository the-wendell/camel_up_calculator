# CamelUpCalculator

NOT YET WORKING (almost :D)

This is a gem that calculates the odds for a round of CamelUp (CamelCup).
It calculates the odds by running through every possible outcome and then
uses the results to determine the odds for a given camel winning.

For example: In 1000 possible outcomes Yellow placed 1st 100 times then
yellow will have a 10% chance of winning as every possible outcome is as
likely as anyother single possible outcome.

This calculation is given for each camel and for each position.  This means
it is possible to determine the odds for any camel finishing in any position.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'camel_up_calculator'

    $ bundle
